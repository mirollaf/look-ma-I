	  <p class="card-text">A few of his most celebrated pieces include "Mona Lisa" and "The Last Supper," which showcase his outstanding composition and painting abilities. Leonardo's thorough dissections and detailed sketching, especially demonstrated his knowledge of the human body. These sketches later served as a foundation of the understanding of human anatomy still used till this day.  His unique designs for machinery, flying equipment, and architectural ideas demonstrate his forward-thinking approach to engineering. His blueprints and ideas were later used to advance society, bringing innovative technology. Centuries after his death, people all around the world are still fascinated and inspired by Leonardo's diverse range of accomplishments in the fields of art, science, and technology.</p>

	  <h2 class="card-title">Life Story</h2>
	  <p class="card-text">Leonardo da Vinci was born on April 15, 1452, in Vinci, a town in the Republic of Florence (present-day Italy).Around the age of 14, he started an apprenticeship with the renowned artist Andrea del Verrocchio in Florence. Verrocchio's workshop was a thriving center for artistic learning, and Leonardo gained valuable skills in various artistic disciplines, including painting, sculpture, and drafting.. For example, one of Leonardo's first big breaks was to paint an angel in Verrochio's "Baptism of Christ," and Leonardo was so much better than his master's that Verrochio allegedly resolved never to paint again. Later Leonardo began working for the Duke of Milan in 1482. It was during these years that Leonardo reached new heights of scientific and artistic achievement.The Duke kept Leonardo busy painting and sculpting and designing elaborate court festivals, but he also had Leonardo design weapons, buildings, and machinery. From 1485 to 1490, Leonardo produced studies on many subjects, including nature, flying machines, geometry, mechanics, municipal construction, canals and architecture. His studies from this period contain designs for advanced weapons, including a tank and other war vehicles, various combat devices, and even submarines. Also during this period, Leonardo produced his first anatomical studies. His Milan workshop was abuzz with apprentices and students.</p>
